This project investigates multi-label image classification using deep learning, focusing on classifying images to detect the presence of both dogs and people. Given a limited dataset, the study leverages MobileNet and ResNet-50 architectures to explore the impact of model complexity on performance in data-constrained environments. MobileNet, known for its efficiency and suitability for small datasets, is compared against ResNet-50, a deeper network traditionally used in larger datasets. The models are fine-tuned to classify each image into four categories: "dog only," "person only," "both dog and person," and "neither dog nor person." Through this comparison, the project aims to evaluate which architecture yields the best balance of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization in scenarios with limited labeled data. This study also explores transfer learning and the use of lightweight architectures for multi-label classification, with potential applications in mobile and embedded device settings.
