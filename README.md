Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is an advanced neural network for object detection and classification. There are multiple advanced CNN architectures out there for image classification and detection. ResNet50 and Mobilenet are well-known CNN models. In this study, ResNet50 and Mobilenet CNN models are trained to classify images in a Roboflow dataset. The dataset used for this task is the 'Thermal Dogs and People' dataset which contains thermal infrared images of dogs and people. This project presents how these images are classified by fine-tuning the two CNN models and also discusses the findings, including the effect of batch size and layer selection on model performance.
